Soft Skills Generator
Cherry On Tech Spring Cohort 2024
Saturn Spinners squad

This app was created in response to high occurances of imposter syndrome in individuals, who are new to tech, looking to break into software engineering roles.

The targeted user group is:
- non-male-identifying
- ages 30-45
- seeking software engineering roles
- career switchers
- living outside of a tech-centric city (San Francisco, Seattle, New York, Chicago, etc)

This app helps users identify soft skills previously attained in other industries, in order to help applicants feel better prepared and more qualified for engineering roles.

This app is unique in its goal of identifying valuable soft skills with the goal of building confidence in junior developers, rather than seeking to match individuals with specific roles or expose them to job opportunities.

The constraints of this project include not building a BE and only using free technologies.
